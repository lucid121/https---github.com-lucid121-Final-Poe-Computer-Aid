            <p> Our mission is to bridge the digital divide and to use digital technologies to help overcome disadvantage â€“ and to do so in environmentally friendly ways.

                In part, we do this by providing an IT disposal service for companies and organisations. Our service seeks to reuse as much as possible and in so doing reduces the carbon footprint of the assets. </p>
            <p>Digital technologies are a key driver of economic and social change and those who do not have access to the digital technology or the skills to use it are being increasingly marginalised. Through our work, we help communities and people by bringing new opportunities, unlocked by digital access. </p>
